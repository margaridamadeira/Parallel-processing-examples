# Parallel processing examples

This folder contains the subfolders that demonstrate:
- use of shared memory, using pthreads;
- use of shared memory, using OpenMP;
- use of message passing, using MPI;
- use of hybrid programming, using both MPI and OpenMP.

Heterogeneous programming may be added in the future.


Each folder contains simple C programs and shell scripts allowing the verification of the correct installation of tools.
